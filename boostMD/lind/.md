# 

when open a file

`fileobjecttable[inode] = openfile(FILEDATAPREFIX + str(inode),True)`

this means 

when invoke `openfile`
the real file in real filesystem(not lind) is created
and its name will not be the name you give, but linddata.**

and fileobj is a emulfile obj,

writeat emulfile is "wrapped" write, things written to linddata is like pickle
