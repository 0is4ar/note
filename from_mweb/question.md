# question

how can I see a list of machines with their name

the mostly seen vulnerability in penetration test

how to use nmap to find out good target



looking for most common linux/win local exploit

## record

### way 

1. find a exploit suggester
2. see its source code, know which exploits are included
3. see information of those exploits one by one

### to attack a successfully 

basically two vulnerabilities are needed

one for get a shell
one for escalate to root shell


### escalation

find all processes run by root
thumbnail its version
and search for vuln on google one by one 

### things 

nmap 
ps
netstat
uname
addgroup
sudoer
adduser
