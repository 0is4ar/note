## Companies from which I requested the data

- Google: I requested access to data in takeout.google.com, and then it sends to my google drive
- Facebook: In settings I can saw how they label me
- Apple: Request in apple's privacy webpage, then send my information for authentication  
- Baidu: Send 3 emails to their privacy team. No reply.
- Tencent: Send 3 emails to their privacy team. No reply.

## What did I learn, what's unexpected

These data can cover almost every single corner of my information. I think data from google shocked me a little because I never thought it can be so organized. I even appreciate them to classify my information so well that I can learn more about myself. And their record about which map area I see is the most unexpected part. That means they can almost know where I am anytime.

## Data from different companies

I think it's slight different. For example, the data Facebook collected from me may focus more on which kinds of people I am, and this enable them to push better advertise which is a big source of their profit. But for Google, probably because its main product is search engine, I think Goole just collect as much as data they can.

## Any changes about data I will provide

Of course I think I would change. First I may try not allow those companies to track me if they offer this option. And I will avoid login when using apps like Google Map.
