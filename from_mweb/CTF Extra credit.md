# CTF Extra credit

## What I did
Since I'm new to CTF, I tried to learn it from playing it.

####  OSIRIS recruit

Those are challenges made by NYU OSIRIS club for recruit their member. All are entry level chanllenges from shallow to relatively deep, and gave me a good place to begin with.  

#### RIT CTF

This was the first real CTF I tried to play, since I hope to develop more skills on WEB security, I concentrated more on its WEB challenges. 
### What I learned
####  OSIRIS recruit

This "CTF" gave a good picture of how CTF is, and use of some basic tools.

- Crypto 

for the Crypto part, it gives me a good review of things about RSA. And wrote some brute froce for XOR and two bytes XOR.

- WEB

I learned some basic ideas when playing WEB security chanllenges. Like taking care of Cookie, parameter, resources. And doing some SQL blind injection which is more similiar to real world attack than textbook.

- reverse engineering 

No pwn chanllenges there, I learned basic use of gdb, ollydbg, IDA and Binary Ninja. And learned to analyze a program with much patience. 

- misc

I used to think Misc is boring, but this changed my mind. I learned several totolly different kinds of things, like extract image from wireshark, extract flag from keyboard USB packet, find out files hid in one file.

#### RIT CTF

This gave me total different idea of how Web security challenge in CTF looks like. Somethings like finding flag in a lot of recursive linkds, even finding flag in Youtube comments.
